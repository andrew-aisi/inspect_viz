### interval_x

Select a continuous 1D interval selection over the `x` scale domain.

``` python
def interval_x(

    field: str | None = None,
    pixel_size: float | None = None,
    peers: bool | None = None,
    brush: Brush | None = None,
) -> Interactor
```

`target` [Selection](inspect_viz.qmd#selection)  
The target selection. A clause of the form `field BETWEEN lo AND hi` is
added for the currently selected interval \[lo, hi\].

`field` str \| None  
The name of the field (database column) over which the interval
selection should be defined. If unspecified, the channel field of the
first valid prior mark definition is used.

`pixel_size` float \| None  
The size of an interative pixel (default `1`). Larger pixel sizes reduce
the brush resolution, which can reduce the size of pre-aggregated
materialized views.

`peers` bool \| None  
A flag indicating if peer (sibling) marks are excluded when
cross-filtering (default `true`). If set, peer marks will not be
filtered by this interactor’s selection in cross-filtering setups.
