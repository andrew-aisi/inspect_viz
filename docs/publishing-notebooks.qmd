## Overview

A convenient way to share sets of plots and related commentary is to publish a notebook. There are a couple of straightforward ways to create HTML documents from notebooks ([nbconvert](#nbconvert) and [Quarto](#quarto)), and then these documents can in turn be printed to PDF if required. 

You can also share a live version of a notebook that supports filtering and plot interactions by pubishing it on a platform like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## nbconvert

The [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package enables export of any Jupyter notebook to HTML. Install `nbconvert` with:

```bash
pip install nbconvert
```

Then, convert any notebook which includes Inspect Viz plots as follows:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute notebook.ipynb
```

This will create an HTML file named "notebook.html" alongside the "notebook.ipynb".

You can also specify that you'd like code cells removed using the `--no-input` option:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute --no-input notebook.ipynb
```

If you need a PDF version of the notebook, open the file in a browser and print to PDF.

## Quarto

The [Quarto](https://quarto.org) publishing system can also convert notebooks to HTML. To install the `quarto-cli` Python package:

```bash
pip install quarto-cli
```

Then, convert any notebook which includes Inspect Viz plots as follows:

```bash
quarto render notebook.ipynb --to html --execute
```

This will create an HTML file named "notebook.html" and a directory named "notebook_files" alongside the "notebook.ipynb".

You can also specify that you'd like code cells removed using the `-M echo:false` option:

```bash
quarto render notebook.ipynb --to html --execute -M echo:false
```

If you need a PDF version of the notebook, open the file in a browser and print to PDF.
