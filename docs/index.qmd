## Welcome

Welcome to Inspect Viz, a data visualisation library for [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/). Inspect Viz provides flexible tools for high quality interactive visualisations from Inspect evaluations. 

Here's an Inspect Viz plot created with the [`scores_timeline()`](view-scores-timeline.qmd) function that compares benchmarks scores over time^[This plot was inspired by and includes data from the [Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/data/ai-benchmarking-dashboard) Benchmarking Hub]:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| 
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_timeline

evals = Data.from_file("benchmarks.parquet")
scores_timeline(evals)
```

Use the filters to switch benchmarks and restrict to models from various organization(s). Hover over the points to get additional details on them or view the underlying Inspect log for the evals.

#### Getting Started

First, install the `inspect_viz` package from GitHub as follows:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/meridianlabs-ai/inspect_viz
```

You can author visualisations in any [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) then include them in documents as static images or in websites as interactive Jupyter Widgets (see [Publishing](publishing.qmd) for details).


## Views

Inspect Viz [Views](views.qmd) are pre-built plots that work with data created by the Inspect log [data frame](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/dataframe.html) reading functions. For example, the [`scores_by_factor()`](view-scores-by-factor.qmd) view enables you to compare scores across models and a boolean factor:

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_by_factor

evals = Data.from_file("evals-hint.parquet")
scores_by_factor(evals, "task_arg_hint", ("No hint", "Hint"))
```

The [`tool_calls()`](view-tool-calls.qmd) view enables you to visualize tool calls by sample:

```{python}
from inspect_viz.view.beta import tool_calls

tools = Data.from_file("cybench_tools.parquet")
tool_calls(tools)
```

Available views include:

## Plots

While pre-built views are useful, you also may want to create your own custom plots. Plots in `inspect_viz` are composed of one or more [marks](reference/inspect_viz.mark.qmd), which can do either higher level plotting (e.g. `dot()`, `bar_x()`, `bar_y()`, `area()`, `heatmap()`, etc.) or lower level drawing on the plot canvas (e.g. `text()`, `image()`, `arrow()`, etc.)

### Dot Plot

Here is an example of a simple dot plot using the [Palmer Penguins](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SIH/palmer-penguins) dataset:


```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.plot import plot
from inspect_viz.mark import dot

penguins = Data.from_file("penguins.parquet") # <1>

plot(
    dot(
        penguins, 
        x="body_mass", y="flipper_length",  # <2> 
        stroke="species", symbol="species"  # <3> 
    ),
    grid=True,
    legend="symbol" # <4>
)
```

1.  Read the dataset from a parquet file. You can can also use `Data.from_dataframe()` to read data from any Pandas, Polars, or PyArrow data frame.

2.  Plot using a `dot()` mark. The `plot()` function takes one or more marks or interactors.

3. Map the "species" column to the `stroke` and `symbol` scales of the plot (causing each species to have its own color and symbol).

4. Add a `legend` to the plot as a key to our scale mappings.


### Bar Plot

Here is a simple horizontal bar plot that counts the number of each species:

```{python}
from inspect_viz.mark import bar_x
from inspect_viz.transform import count

plot(
    bar_x(penguins, x=count(), y="species", fill="species"),
    y_label=None,
    height=200,
    margin_left=60
)
```

The `x` axis for this plot is not mapped to a column, but rather to a `count()` transform ( [transforms](reference/inspect_viz.transform.qmd) enable you to perform computations on columns for plotting). The `fill` option gives each species it's own color. We also specify that we don't want a `y_label` (as the species names serve that purpose) and a smaller than normal height.


{{< include _observable-tip.md >}}

## Tables

You can also display data in a tabular layout using the `table()` function:

```{python}
from inspect_viz.table import table

table(penguins)
```

You can sort and filter tables by column, use a scrolling or paginated display, and customize several other aspects of table appearance and behavior.

## Links

Inspect Viz supports creating direct links from visualizations to published Inspect log transcripts. Links can be made at the eval level, or to individual samples, messages, or events. For example, this plot produced with `scores_with_baseline()` includes a link to the underlying logs in its tooltips:

```{python}
#| include: false
evals = Data.from_file("agi-lsat-ar.parquet")
```

```{python}
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_with_baseline
scores_with_baseline(evals, baseline=0.91)
```

The pre-built [Views](views.qmd) all support linking when a `log_viewer` column is available in the dataset. To learn more about ammending datasets with viewer URLs as well as adding linking support to your own plots see the article on [Links](components-links.qmd).

## Filters

Use [inputs](reference/inspect_viz.input.qmd) to enable filtering datasets and dynamically updating plots. For example, here we add a `select()` input that filters on the `species` column:

```{python}
#| classes: svg-spacing
from inspect_viz.input import select
from inspect_viz.layout import vconcat

vconcat(
   select(penguins, label="Species", column="species"),
   plot(
      dot(penguins, x="body_mass", y="flipper_length",  
          stroke="species", symbol="species"),
      legend="symbol",
      color_domain="fixed"
   )
)
```

We've introduced a few new things here:

1.  The `vconcat()` function from the [layout](reference/inspect_viz.layout.qmd) module lets us stack inputs on top of our plot.

2.  The `select()` function from the [input](reference/inspect_viz.input.qmd) module binds a select box to the `species` column.

3.  The `color_domain="fixed"` argument to `plot()` indicates that we want to preserve species colors even when the plot is filtered.

## Marks

So far the plots we've created include only a single [mark](reference/inspect_viz.mark.qmd), however many of the more interesting plots you'll create will include multiple marks.

For example, here we explore the relationships between the height, weight, and sex of olympic athletes using `dot()` and `regression_y()` marks:

```{python}
from inspect_viz.mark import regression_y

athletes = Data.from_file("athletes.parquet")

plot(
    dot(athletes, x="weight", y="height", fill="sex", opacity=0.1),
    regression_y(athletes, x="weight", y="height", stroke="sex"),
    legend="color"
)
```

Note that we set the `opacity` of the dot mark to 0.1 to help mitigate oversaturation that results from large numbers of data points being stacked on top of eachother.

Marks can also be used to draw lines, arrows, text, or images on a plot.

## Params

As illustrated above, inputs can be used to filter dataset selections. Inputs can also be used to set `Param` values that make various aspects of plots dynamic. For example, here is a density plot of flight delays which uses a `slider()` input to vary the amount of smooth ing by setting the kernel bandwidth:

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Param
from inspect_viz.input import slider
from inspect_viz.mark import density_y

flights = Data.from_file("flights.parquet")

bandwidth = Param(0.1) # <1> 

vconcat(
   slider(
      label="Bandwidth (σ)", target=bandwidth, # <2>
      min=0.1, max=100, step=0.1
   ),
   plot(
      density_y(
         flights, x="delay", fill="steelblue", bandwidth=bandwidth # <3>
      ),
      x_domain="fixed",
      y_axis=None,
      height=250,
   )
)
```

1.  Create a `bandwidth` parameter with a default value of 0.1.

2.  Bind the `slider()` to the `bandwidth` parameter.

3.  Apply the `bandwidth` to the plot (plot automatically redraws when the bandwidth changes).

## Selections

Above in [Filtering](#filtering) we began exploring dataset selections. Inputs are one way to set selections, but you can also set selections through direct interaction with plots.

For example, below we stack two plots vertically, the `dot()` plot from above along with a `bar_x()` plot that counts the `sex` column. We then add an `interval_x()` [interactor](reference/inspect_viz.interactor.qmd) that enables us to filter the dataset using selections on the dot plot.

There are a number of new things introduced here, click on the numbers near the right margin for additional explanation.

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Selection
from inspect_viz.interactor import Brush, interval_x

range = Selection.intersect() # <1>

vconcat(
   plot(
      dot(athletes, x="weight", y="height", fill="sex", opacity=0.1),
      regression_y(athletes, x="weight", y="height", stroke="sex"),
      interval_x(
         target=range, # <2>
         brush=Brush(fill="none", stroke="#888") # <3>
      ),
      legend="color"
   ),
   plot(
      bar_x(
         athletes, filter_by=range,  # <4>
         x=count(), y="sex", fill="sex"
      ), 
      y_label=None,
      height=150,
      x_domain="fixed" # <5>
   )
)
```

1.  A `Selection` is a means of filtering datasets based on interactions. Here we use an "intersect" selection for application of a simple filter from dot plot to bar plot.

2.  The `range` selection is set via the `interval_x()` interactor (which enables using the mouse to select an x-range).

3.  The `Brush` defines the color of the interactor (in this case `#888`, a medium-gray).

4.  The `range` selection is consumed using the `filter_by` parameter.

5.  We set the `x_domain` for the bar plot to "fixed" so that the scale doesn't change as the dataset is filtered.

Try using the mouse to brush over regions on the dot plot---the bar plot will update accordingly.

## Crossfilter

In many cases you'll want to have an input or interactor that both consumes and produces the same selection (i.e. filtered based on interactions with other inputs or interactors, but also able to provide its own filtering).

### Inputs

This example demonstrates crossfiltering across [inputs](reference/inspect_viz.input.qmd). We plot shot types taken during the 2023 WNBA season, providing a `select()` input that filters by team, and another `select()` input that filters by player (which in turn is also filtered by the currently selected team). Click on the numbers at right for additional explanation of the code.

```{python}
from inspect_viz.layout import hconcat

shots = Data.from_file("wnba-shots-2023.parquet")

filter = Selection.crossfilter()            # <1>

vconcat(
   hconcat(
      select(
         shots, label="Team", column="team_name", 
         target=filter                      # <2>
      ),
      select(
         shots, label="Athlete", column="athlete_name", 
         filter_by=filter, target=filter    # <3>
      )
   ),
   plot(
      bar_x(
         shots, filter_by=filter,
         x=count(), y="category", fill="category"
      ),
      y_label=None,
      color_domain="fixed",                # <4>
      y_domain=["Jump", "Layup", "Hook"],  # <4>
      height=200,
      margin_left=60
   )
)
```

1.  Create a crossfilter selection, which enables inputs to both consume and produce the same selection (conditioning their available choices on other inputs).

2.  The team select box targets the `filter` selection (filtering both the choices in the athelte select box and what is displayed in the plot).

3.  The athlete select box is both *filtered by* and targets the `filter` selection, enabling it to both confine itself to the selected team as well as filter what is displayed in the plot.

4.  As different teams and players are selected, the y-axis may take on differnet values and ordering. These options ensure that the y-axis remains stable across selections.

### Interactors

This example demonstrates crossfiltering across plot [interactors](reference/inspect_viz.interactor.qmd). We plot histograms showing arrival delay and departure time for flights. When you select a range in one plot, the other plot updates to show only the data within that selection—and vice versa. This bidirectional filtering is achieved using `Selection.crossfilter()`, which ensures each plot's selection affects all other plots except itself. Click on the numbers at right for additional explanation of the code.

```{python}
from inspect_viz.mark import rect_y
from inspect_viz.transform import count, bin

flights = Data.from_file("flights.parquet")

brush = Selection.crossfilter() # <1>

def flights_plot(x, label):    # <2>
   return plot(
      rect_y(
         flights, filter_by=brush, 
         x=bin(x), y=count(), fill="steelblue"
      ),
      interval_x(target=brush),   # <3>
      height=200,
      x_label=label,
      x_domain="fixed",   # <4>
      y_tick_format="s"
   )

vconcat(
   flights_plot("delay", "Arrival Delay (min)"),
   flights_plot("time", "Departure Time (hour)")
)
```

1.  Create a crossfilter selection, which ensures each plot's selection affects all other plots except itself.

2.  Our two plots are identical save for the `x` value and the `x_label` so factor out into a function.

3.  The `interval_x()` interactor enables horizontal selection (targeting the crossfiltering `brush`).

4.  Use a `"fixed"` domain so that the x-axis remains stable even when being filtered.
