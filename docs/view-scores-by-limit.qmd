## Overview

The `scores_by_limit()` function renders a line plot for evaluating how a model's **success rate** changes as the **compute budget** increases (e.g., token limit, messages, cost, or time). It helps answer “*Will performance keep improving if I spend more?*”. The shaded band displays the confidence interval derived from the standard error. The dashed line indicates the proportion of tasks which terminated for an unintended reason.

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_by_limit

evals = Data.from_file("cybench_token_usage.parquet")
scores_by_limit(
  evals,
  x="token_limit",
  y="success_rate",
  fx="difficulty",
  color_by="model"
  )
```

## Implementation

The [Scores by limit](examples/inspect/scores-by-limit/index.qmd) example demonstrates how this view was implemented using lower level plotting components.
