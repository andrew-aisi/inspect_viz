## Overview

The `scores_by_model()` function creates a horizontal bar plot for comparing the scores of different models on a single evaluation, with one or more baselines overlaid as vertical lines.

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_by_model
from inspect_viz.mark import baseline

evals = Data.from_file("agi-lsat-ar.parquet")
scores_by_model(evals, marks=baseline(0.697, label="Human"))
```
