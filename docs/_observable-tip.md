Inspect Viz is built on top of the [Mosaic](https://idl.uw.edu/mosaic/) data visualization system which is in turn built on [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/). 

Below we'll describe the the Inspect Viz Python API, which typically maps quite closely to the Observable Plot JavaScript API. Once you start creating your own plots and are using Google or an LLM to help with development, asking how to do things in Observable Plot will typically yield actionable advice.
