## Overview

The `scores_heatmap()`function renders a heatmap for comparing eval scores.

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_heatmap

evals = Data.from_file("evals.parquet")
scores_heatmap(evals, height=200)
```

## Data Preparation

The scores heatmap plot is intended to operate on data read directly from an Inspect log directory with the [`evals_df()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#evals_df) function. In addition, if the data frame is amended with [links](components-links.qmd) they are used automatically in the plot's tooltips.

## Implementation

The [Scores Heatmap](examples/inspect/scores-heatmap/index.qmd) example demonstrates how this view was implemented using lower level plotting components.
