# Inspect Viz

> Welcome to Inspect Viz, a data visualisation library for [Inspect
AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/). Inspect Viz provides flexible tools
for creating high quality interactive visualisations from Inspect evaluations.

The the two most useful documentation sections are:

- The Docs section, which provides a comprehensive overview of how to create custom plots. Use it to determine which functions should be used for a given application. If the user is trying to create a new custom plot then this is a good place to start.
- The Examples section, which provides concrete examples of how to use the library. Reading this code is a good way to understand the most common features and usage patterns.

If you want to drill into specific functions, the Reference section provides comprehensive details on each function in the library.

Finally, these sections provide additional related documentation:

- The Views section provides documentation on pre-built plots for specific scenarios. 
- The Publishing section provides documetnation on how to publish visualizations as static images, notebooks, websites, and dashboards.
