## Overview

The `scores_with_baseline()` function creates a horizontal bar plot for comparing the scores of different models on a single evaluation, with one or more baselines overlaid as vertical lines.

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_with_baseline, Baseline

evals = Data.from_file("agi-lsat-ar.parquet")
scores_with_baseline(evals, baseline=0.697)
```


## Data Preparation

The scores with baseilne plot is intended to operate on data read directly from an Inspect log directory with the [`evals_df()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#evals_df) function. In addition, if the data frame is amended with [links](components-links.qmd) they are used automatically in the plot's tooltips.

## Implementation

The [Scores with Baseline](examples/inspect/scores-with-baseline/index.qmd) example demonstrates how this view was implemented using lower level plotting components.
