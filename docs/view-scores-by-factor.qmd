## Overview

The `scores_by_factor()` function renders a bar plot for comparing eval scores by model and a boolean factor (e.g. non-reasoning vs. reasoning, no hint vs. hint, etc.). 

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_by_factor

evals = Data.from_file("evals-hint.parquet")
scores_by_factor(evals, "task_arg_hint", ("No hint", "Hint"))
```


## Data Preparation

{{< include _data_preparation.md >}}

You should also ensure that your evals data frame has a boolean field corresponding to the factor you are splitting on (in the example above this is "task_arg_hint").

## Implementation

The [Scores by Factor](examples/inspect/scores-by-factor/index.qmd) example demonstrates how this view was implemented using lower level plotting components.
