## Overview

The `scores_by_task()` function renders a bar plot for comparing eval scores.

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_by_task

evals = Data.from_file("evals.parquet")
scores_by_task(evals)
```


## Data Preparation

The scores by task plot is intended to operate on data read directly from an Inspect log directory with the [`evals_df()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#evals_df) function. In addition, the data frame was amended with [links](components-links.qmd) to log files.

## Implementation

The [Scores by Task](examples/inspect/scores-by-task/index.qmd) example demonstrates how this view was implemented using lower level plotting components.
