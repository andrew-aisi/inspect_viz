::: callout-note
View functions are currently in beta and are exported from the **inspect_ai.view.beta** module. The beta module will be preserved after final release so that code written against it now will continue to work after the beta.
:::

Inspect Viz [Views](views.qmd) are pre-built plots that work with data created by the Inspect log [data frame](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/dataframe.html) reading functions.
