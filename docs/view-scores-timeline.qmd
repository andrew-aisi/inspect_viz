## Overview

The `scores_timeline()` function plots eval scores by model, organization, and release date:

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_timeline

evals = Data.from_file("benchmarks.parquet")
scores_timeline(evals)
```

The benchmark data used for this plot was sourced from [Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/data/ai-benchmarking-dashboard).

## Data Preparation

{{< include _data_preparation.md >}}

Notet that this view depends upon the presence of columns added by [`model_info()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#model_info) (such as `model_release_date`) so must be prepared as shown above.

## Implementation
