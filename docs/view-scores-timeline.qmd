## Overview

The `scores_timeline()` function plots eval scores by model, organization, and release date^[This plot was inspired by and includes data from the [Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/data/ai-benchmarking-dashboard) Benchmarking Hub]:

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_timeline

evals = Data.from_file("benchmarks.parquet")
scores_timeline(evals)
```


## Data Preparation

Above we read the data for the plot from a parquet file. This file was in turn created by:

1. Reading logs into a data frame with [`evals_df()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#evals_df).

2. Using the [`prepare()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#prepare) function to add [`model_info()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#model_info), [`frontier()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#frontier) and [`log_viewer()`](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/reference/inspect_ai.analysis.html#model_info) columns to the data frame.

```python
from inspect_ai.analysis.beta import (
    evals_df, frontier, log_viewer, model_into, prepare
)

df = evals_df("logs")
df = prepare(df, 
    model_info(),
    frontier(),
    log_viewer("eval", {"logs": "https://samples.meridianlabs.ai/"}),
)
df.to_parquet("{{< meta datafile>}}")
```

## Filtering

A `select()` input for tasks is automatically provided if more than one task exists in the `data`. A `checkbox_group()` is automatically provided for organizations if more than one organization exists (you can disable this with `organizations_filter=False`).

When multiple organizations exist, clicking on the legend for an organization will filter the plot by that organization.

## Implementation

The [Scores Timeline](examples/inspect/scores-timeline/index.qmd) example demonstrates how this view was implemented using lower level plotting components.
