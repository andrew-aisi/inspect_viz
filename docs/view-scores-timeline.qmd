## Overview

The `scores_timeline()` function plots eval scores by model, organization, and release date.

```{python}
from inspect_viz import Data
from inspect_viz.view.beta import scores_timeline

evals = Data.from_file("benchmarks.parquet")
scores_timeline(evals)
```


## Data Preparation

{{< include _data_preparation.md >}}

Since this view depends upon the presence of columns (such as `model_release_date`), data must be prepared with `model_info()`.


## Function Reference {reference="scores_timeline"}

## Implementation

The [Scores Timeline](examples/inspect/scores-timeline/index.qmd) example demonstrates how this view was implemented using lower level plotting components.
